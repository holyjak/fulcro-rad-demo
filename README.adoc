= Broken routing from URL

This is based on `fulcro-rad-demo` and demonstrates problems with nested dynamic routers and hard-reload of a URL, for https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro/discussions/440

While it works to click through the UI to arrive to a particular view, when I try to load the resulting URL I will not get the same view.

=== Current problem

==== Facts

== Code structure

The code is based on RAD demo but the UI has been simplified and a new level of routing with `dr/deferred` has been added between the MainRouter and the AccountList report:

* Root
** MainRouter `router`
*** LandingPage `defsc`
*** Accounts `defsc`, `dr/deferred`
**** AccountsDetailsRouter `router`
***** AccountsDetailDefault `defsc`
***** AccountList `rad/report`
